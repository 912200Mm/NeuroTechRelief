Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) ‘’Portable device’’ (TENS) therapy relieves chronic and acute pain using low-voltage electrical current. The project aims to create a portable device using NeruoStimDuino and Arduino Due programmed with C++. The device will include an electric circuit and a TFT display for controlling the electrical pulses, and a mobile app for user convenience. Our goal is to provide pain relief for patients.

The software that was used to implement the wiring Diagram is Fritzing. Fritzing is 
an electronics design and prototyping platform for makers, hobbyists, and educators. 
Easily create and document electronic projects.

As We See We Connect Nextion Display to UART2 in Esp32 "Rx2" & "Tx2" and Print the orders in main UART"Rx"&"Tx" The Arduino Mega take this order and it translates orders to NeurostMedino and then executes it

This is the flowchart, the user launches the application, if the bluetooth is open, he will be directed to the home page, if otherwise he will be asked to open the bluetooth at first, after that there are two options for the user, wether he uses the pre-set automatic program or customize his manual program, after the choice is made the user will be directed to the settings to choose any of both channels and enter the parameters of his choice. At that point, the stim mode will be activated and the stimulation begins.

In the future of the application, our own server and IP will be created so that patient information is preserved if needed at any time.
